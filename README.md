Allows players to opt into fighting phantoms.

Phantom Lucidity requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) if it is not installed.
2. Download Phantom Lucidity from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phantom-lucidity/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Phantom-Lucidity/releases).
3. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, phantoms will spawn with a translucent appearance. In this state, phantoms will not make noise and will not attempt to attack players. In addition, if killed in this state, phantoms will not drop loot or experience.

Players can look at a phantom through a spyglass to reveal it. After a phantom has been revealed, it will resume its normal attack behavior and drop loot if killed.

### Tags

Items added to the `#phantomlucidity:phantoms_revealed_while_using` tag will reveal phantoms while they are actively being used. Spyglasses are in this tag by default.
